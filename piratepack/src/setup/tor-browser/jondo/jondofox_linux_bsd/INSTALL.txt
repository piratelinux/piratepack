
JonDoFox installation 
---------------------

Unpack the TAR archive by:

    # tar -xjf jondofox_linux_bsd-en-US.tar.bz2

Open a terminal and change to the path that contains the file "install_jondofox.sh"
(the folder which you unpacked).

    # cd jondofox_linux_bsd

Now execute the installation script by entering the following command:

    # ./install_jondofox.sh

If you have already installed JonDoFox, you are asked if you want to overwrite your 
existing JonDoFox isntallation. Your bookmarks and other settings are preserved.

IMPORTANT: If you want to run the linux installation script, DON'T DOUBLECLICK on 
the file "install_linux.sh"! Always run this script in a TERMINAL!
